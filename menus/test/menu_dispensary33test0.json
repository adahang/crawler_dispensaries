    "description": "Bubba Diagonal is an interesting cross of Bubba and Triangle Kush, two clone-only strains that both have OG Kush in their genealogy. This new line of Cartridges from Grassroots is a unique product to the Illinois market as it differs from other Sauce Cartridges by used cured rather than “live” plant material. The result is a full and diverse terpene profile and a nuanced cerebral and physical euphoria. The flavor is akin to pinecone, with an added citric and earthy quality."

For use in these Pax Era Cartridges, a Live Resin was created using a hydrocarbon extraction and then diluted with relatively odorless and tasteless plant derived terpenes at a rate of 8%. Slightly more energizing than other CBD rich cartridges, with a mellow physical “high”. Pomelo and tropical hard candy dominate the palate, with a touch of pine."
